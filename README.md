  2. 2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find the closest concert date.

     1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top, there is a clean navigation bar. Each link describes the page they will end up at clearly.

     3. After the hero image, there is the gig section where the user can find the next dates.

     1. In the music section, the user can see the album released.
     2. There is the possibility to buy the previous albums and to pre-order the next one.

     1. The navigation bar highlights the "Contact" Page.
     2. The user is provided with the email addresses for info, bookings, and press.
     3. Alternatively, the user can directly fill out the form on the page.

     5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill their email address in the "To" section.

  3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.
     1. The YouTube, Facebook, Soundcloud, Instagram, Spotify, and Twitter pages can be found at the footer and open a new tab.

     1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily go to the music section to check the most recent album.

  2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new items to shop in the store section.

### Further Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX, iPad.
- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
- Band members were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- The site doesn't fully support screen sizes less than 320px.

### Solved Bugs

- For small screen size (375px) there was an extra padding by default in the bootstrap row solved with custom css:
```
.row > * {
  padding-right: 0px;
  padding-left: 0px;
}
```

- The logo doesn't look good in rotated small devices, solved by hiding in small and medium screens:
```
<div class="logo-holder d-none d-lg-block">
                                <img src="assets/images/logo/logo-2.png" alt="logo">
                            </div>
```
